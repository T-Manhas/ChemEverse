# ChemEverse
For this project, you will incorporate virtual companies. Each company will have the following 
organizational structure.
Each company will do following activities:
1. Management: CEO will oversee each step described below.
2. Market analysis: Identify high-value chemicals that can be made in India. You will 
screen at least 3 such chemicals and finalise one chemical. They would be from fine or 
specialty chemicals. These chemicals will not be from bulk chemicals. It will not be a 
consumer product. Some examples include intermediates used in agro, pharma, paint, 
surfactant, perfume, beauty products etc. When finalising you will consider 
profitability, availability of raw materials, safety. (Some useful resources include 
reports available on chemical industry 
from https://chemicals.gov.in, https://www.ibef.org/, http://cpmaindia.com, KPMG 
etc.). Get material input cost and product cost from Internet (e.g. Zauba which tracks 
import and export data)
3. R&D - chemical synthesis: R&D team will come up with chemical reactions and 
separation steps from lab-scale research available on internet. R&D team will give 
chemicals required, purity and yield of the product that can be achieved. Supporting 
patents & research articles will be collected. (Scifinder; register an account using IITK 
address, Google Scholar/Patents)
4. Technical services: Takes inputs from the R&D team, market analysis team, and 
management. Design team will develop a block diagram for scaled-up process, perform 
material balance, identify unit operations and operating conditions. Capacity of the 
plant would be 1000 kg/day of product. Technical services team will also evaluate the 
approximate capital cost (you can use this 
reference. http://www.matche.com/equipcost/Default.html).
5. Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS): Based on the inputs from technical services 
team, EHS team will identify safety concerns, estimate the amount of waste generation 
& propose a plan to monitor and treat them to environmentally benign compounds for 
disposal.
